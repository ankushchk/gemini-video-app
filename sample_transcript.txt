[00:00:15] Joe Rogan: So you're telling me that AI is going to change everything? Like, fundamentally reshape society?

[00:00:22] Elon Musk: Absolutely. I think AI is the most important thing humanity has ever worked on. More important than fire, electricity, or anything else.

[00:00:30] Joe Rogan: Wow, that's a bold statement. Why do you think that?

[00:00:35] Elon Musk: Because it's more profound than electricity or fire. It's going to amplify human capability by orders of magnitude. We're talking about something that could solve problems we can't even imagine solving today.

[00:00:48] Joe Rogan: But doesn't that scare you? I mean, you've been one of the most vocal people warning about AI dangers.

[00:00:54] Elon Musk: It terrifies me. That's exactly why I'm working on it. If you see a freight train coming at humanity, you don't just stand there and watch. You try to build the tracks in a direction that doesn't lead to a cliff.

[00:01:08] Joe Rogan: So you're saying we need to be involved in shaping it rather than just letting it happen to us?

[00:01:13] Elon Musk: Exactly. The worst thing we could do is be passive observers. We need to actively participate in creating beneficial AI. That's why I started Neuralink and why I'm so focused on AI safety.

[00:01:26] Joe Rogan: Let's talk about Neuralink for a second. You're literally putting chips in people's brains. How is that not dystopian?

[00:01:33] Elon Musk: Here's the thing people don't get - we already have a chip in our brain. It's called a smartphone. You're already a cyborg, you just have a really slow data rate to your digital extension of yourself.

[00:01:45] Joe Rogan: That's wild. I never thought about it that way.

[00:01:48] Elon Musk: Think about it. You have instant access to all human knowledge through your phone. The limitation is the interface - your thumbs typing on glass. Neuralink just makes that connection faster and more seamless.

[00:02:02] Joe Rogan: So it's not about becoming more machine-like, it's about enhancing what we already are?

[00:02:07] Elon Musk: Precisely. It's about keeping pace with AI. If AI is going to be vastly smarter than humans, we need to increase our bandwidth to it. Otherwise, we're like house cats watching humans - we have no idea what's really going on.

[00:02:22] Joe Rogan: The house cat analogy is perfect. That's exactly what I'm afraid of - becoming irrelevant.

[00:02:28] Elon Musk: That's the risk if we don't act. But I'm optimistic. I think we can create a future where humans and AI coexist in a symbiotic relationship. We just need to be intentional about it.

[00:02:40] Joe Rogan: What about the people who say you're playing God? That we shouldn't mess with human biology like this?

[00:02:46] Elon Musk: We've been "playing God" since we invented medicine. Every time you take an antibiotic, you're intervening in natural processes. The question isn't whether we should intervene, it's how we intervene responsibly.

[00:03:00] Joe Rogan: Fair point. So what's the timeline on this? When do regular people get brain chips?

[00:03:05] Elon Musk: We're already doing human trials. I expect within five to ten years, you'll see Neuralink helping people with paralysis, blindness, and other conditions. The consumer applications will come later, but they're coming.

[00:03:20] Joe Rogan: That's insane. We're living in a science fiction movie.

[00:03:24] Elon Musk: We are. And the crazy part? This is just the beginning. The rate of change is accelerating. What we consider impossible today will be commonplace in a decade.

[00:03:35] Joe Rogan: Do you ever worry that we're moving too fast? That we should slow down and think about the implications?

[00:03:41] Elon Musk: I used to think that. But here's the problem - the technology is coming whether we like it or not. China, Russia, other countries are racing ahead. If the good guys don't build it first, the bad guys will. And that's a much scarier scenario.

[00:03:58] Joe Rogan: So it's a race, and we have to win?

[00:04:01] Elon Musk: It's a race we can't afford to lose. The stakes are literally the future of human consciousness. That's why I'm so obsessed with this. It's not about money or fame - it's about ensuring humanity has a future worth living in.

[00:04:16] Joe Rogan: Man, that's heavy. But also inspiring. You're basically saying we have agency in shaping our future.

[00:04:22] Elon Musk: We do. But only if we act. Passivity is a choice, and it's the wrong one. We need more people thinking about these problems, working on solutions, and demanding that AI development happens transparently and safely.

[00:04:36] Joe Rogan: What can regular people do? Most of us aren't building AI or brain chips.

[00:04:41] Elon Musk: Stay informed. Demand accountability from tech companies. Support organizations working on AI safety. And most importantly, don't be afraid of the future. Fear leads to paralysis. We need optimism and action.

[00:04:56] Joe Rogan: That's a great place to end. Elon Musk, everybody. Thanks for being here, man.

[00:05:00] Elon Musk: Thanks for having me, Joe. Always a pleasure.
